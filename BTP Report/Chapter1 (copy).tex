\subsection{The  Oracle Airline Data Model}
The  Oracle  Airline Data Model is a powerful logical and physical data model that will help  airlines effectively store, manage, and analyze airline data that currently resides in passenger service systems (includes
reservation systems and departure control systems), global distribution system (GDS), loyalty management systems, and customer data warehouses.  It provides a single scalable repository for transactional and historical data 
that can be used to provide real-time business intelligence and strategic 
insights you’re  your airline. Using sophisticated trending and data mining capabilities based on Oracle’s  OLAP and data mining technology,  airline personnel will now have the data analysis  capabilities to develop Airline -specific insights that are relevant, actionable, and can improve both top-line and bottom-line results. 

The Oracle Airline Data Model provides detail transaction storage and advanced analysis into a full range of airline
subject areas, including reservations, sales, operations, loyalty, 
and finance.  Using reservation data, the data model can provide detailed insight into passenger bookings by time period, fare class, and flight.  It provides insights into channel performance looking at bookings, cancellations, and revenues through travel agency, OTA, ticket counter, call center, and web channels.  It allows you to analyze passenger 
revenues by geography, time period, and flight.  Finally it provides insights into loyalty program member activity through a variety of reports.  
The data model fits the needs of large network carriers and low-cost carriers.
